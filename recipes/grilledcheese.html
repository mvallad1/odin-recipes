        <p>This is a recipe to make a grilled cheese at home. Please make sure you have all necessary ingredients before you begin. This recipe will take approximately 10 minutes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of bread (white, whole wheat, or sourdough)</li>
            <li>2-3 slices of cheese (cheddar, American, Swiss, or your favorite cheese)</li>
            <li>Butter or margarine (for spreading on the bread)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your skillet or frying pan: Place it over medium heat on the stove.</li>
            <li>Butter the bread: Take one slice of bread and spread butter or margarine on one side.</li>
            <li>Add cheese: Place the cheese slices on the unbuttered side of the bread.</li>
            <li>Assemble the sandwich: Place the other slice of bread on top of the cheese, with the buttered side facing outwards.</li>
            <li>Grill the sandwich: Carefully transfer the assembled sandwich to the preheated skillet or frying pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Flip the sandwich: Use a spatula to carefully flip the sandwich over and cook the other side until it's golden brown and the cheese is fully melted.</li>
            <li>Serve hot: Once both sides are golden brown and the cheese is melted, remove the sandwich from the skillet and place it on a plate. Cut it in half if desired, and serve immediately while it's still warm and gooey.</li>
        </ol>
