        <p>This is a recipe to make pizza at home. Please make sure you have all necessary ingredients before you begin. This recipe will take approximately 2 hours.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>Pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Topping of your choice</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Cornmeal or flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on your pizza dough package or recipe (usually around 425째F to 475째F or 220째C to 240째C).</li>
            <li>Prepare your pizza dough according to the instructions if using homemade dough. If using store-bought dough, remove it from the packaging and let it sit at room temperature for about 20-30 minutes to allow it to relax.</li>
            <li>Lightly dust a clean surface with flour and stretch or roll out the pizza dough into your desired shape (round, square, etc.). If you prefer a thicker crust, leave it a bit thicker; for a thinner crust, roll it out more thinly.</li>
            <li>Place the stretched dough onto a pizza peel or a parchment-lined baking sheet lightly dusted with cornmeal or flour to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce, covering the entire pizza.</li>
            <li>Add your desired toppings over the cheese. Be mindful not to overload the pizza, as it may become too heavy and soggy during baking.</li>
            <li> Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza for added flavor and to help brown the crust.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
            <li>Once done, carefully remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
