        <p>This is a recipe to make a spaghetti at home. Please make sure you have all necessary ingredients before you begin. This recipe will take approximately 20 minutes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>28 ounces (225 grams) of spaghetti</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (60ml) of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Prepare the garlic oil: While the spaghetti is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is golden brown and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
            <li>Combine spaghetti with garlic oil: Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it and add it directly to the skillet with the garlic oil. Toss well to coat the spaghetti evenly with the garlic oil. If the spaghetti seems dry, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</li>
            <li>Season and garnish: Season the spaghetti with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley.</li>
            <li>Serve: Divide the spaghetti aglio e olio among serving plates. Optionally, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top before serving.</li>
        </ol>
